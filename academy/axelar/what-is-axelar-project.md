# What is Axelar project?

**Axelar** is a platform offering fast and convenient solution for decentralized applications launch and using on various blockchains. Axelar reduces developer's efforts and time spendings when some application intended to be run on different blockchains is developed. Also Axelar allows any crypto user to operate with his crypto without using centralized services due to embedded crosschain and dApp development solutions into Axelar toolkit.

Imagine that you develop some decentalized application. To do this, you need to choose a network in which your app will operate. For example you chose Ethereum blockchain as such network. However, decentralized world is progressing very fast, and you need to keep upgrading your product and make it more flexible and usable. Therefore you can face with necessity to make your app accessible on other networks, e. g. Bitcoin, Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche etc. How to resolve this issue? The most obvious solution is to redevelop the application in order to run it on another blockchain. But such redevelopmnet requires knowledge of another programing language and redesign of the app's architecture to fit new blockchain. So that is expensive work requiring a lot of resources.

Axelar helps us to overcome these difficulties. You can develop your application in the Axelar network and then it can be launched on the following networks by default:

* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Stellar
* Terra
* Algorand
* Cosmos
* Avalanche
* Polkadot

### Advantages of Axelar

* Develop one app for the most fundamental and popular ecosystems in the Axelar network using Axelar API and Axelar SDK
* Use crosschain interconnection tools of Axelar toolkit to create custom crosschain solutions like bridges, crosschain dApps and links between blockchains
* Liquidity transfers between blockchains

As we see, Axelar network provides impressive opportunities for cryptocurrency users, for example access to various blockchains and operations with assets from the only wallet. This is a strategic purpose of decentralization promoters which frees users from centralized financial services dependence. Axelar is a gateway to completely decentralized world.
