# Mina Glossary

This is our Mina glossary. This is to serve as a reference point for our Mina documentation and for Mina Academy (**Table1**). The entries are made in alphabetic order. Each term has an index for easier navigation. It’s critical to understand that this list is, for the most part, full, but, perhaps, not exhaustive. Furthermore, with time some terms and definitions may change, new terms and definitions may be added. Thus, this glossary is open for changes and comments.
