# Reward Calculation

Mina blockchain offers a reward for **block production** to encourage **nodes** to produce new **blocks** so that the blockchain will be continuously maintained. You can get a **reward** for staking Mina either by running a node and producing blocks or by **delegating** **tokens** to a **validator**. Validators that stake Mina get 100% of the reward they win minus the reward of their **delegators** and the **snark-work fee** (see **Formula 1**).

### Glossary Reference 1

{% hint style="info" %}
**Block** - a discrete unit of a blockchain that carries information about transactions, which is recorded in a special cryptographic way.

**Block production** - the process of producing blocks, which includes adding transactions to a block and recording them therein in a cryptographic manner, as well as gossipping network participants and adding a new block to the network.

**Delegation** - a type of blockchain consensus protocol that allows users to spend their coins or tokens to vote for different delegates.

**Delegator** - an account that makes its staking by providing its own funds to a node rather than running its own node.

**Node** - a device (such as a computer) that contains a copy of the blockchain's transaction history and maintains a blockchain.

**Reward** - tokens paid to a block producer for block production to encourage it to engage in maintaining the blockchain consistency.

**Snarker fee** - a fee for using the network node that provides ZK-proof.

**Validator** - a node that maintains the integrity of the blockchain by constantly calculating the link from the first block to the last one and by approving new blocks created by block producers.

<summary>Formula1: Validator Reward Calculation</summary>

**BR = CR+TF+SF +(\*SR),**

where **BR** - block reward,

**CR** - coinbase reward,

**TF** - transaction fee,

**SF** - snark-work fee,

**SR** - supercharged reward.

Winning a reward for block creation is a lottery and the chances depend on the validatorâ€™s pool share: the higher the pool share is, the more chances a validator has to win block production. The amount of the reward paid depends on the **coinbase**. For producing a regular block the coinbase is 720 Mina, for a **supercharged block** the coinbase is 2x, i.e. 1440 Mina. This happens only if the accounts that take part in block creation, contain only unlocked tokens.

### Glossary Reference 2

{% hint style="info" %}
**Coinbase** - the amount of coins rewarded.

**Supercharged block** - a block, for which a supercharged reward is paid; a supercharged reward for block production in the amount of 1440 Mina paid when a certain condition is met, i.e. when the token holder has fully unlocked tokens.

See [Mina glossary](mina-glossary.md).

Delegators can win a reward in the result of a delegation, and its size depends on their stake (share) in the **validator pool**: the bigger stake a delegator has in the validator pool, the bigger share of the reward it can receive. Delegation is beneficial for both validators and delegators: the first charge a fee for a delegation from delegators, the latter get a chance to participate in staking without having to run a node. The amount of the reward paid to a delegator is calculated as specified by **Formula 2**.

### Glossary Reference 3

{% hint style="info" %}
**Validator pool** - a pool which consists of the stake of elected validators.

<summary>Formula 2: Delegator Reward Calculation</summary>

**DR = (BR\*S + (SR)) \* (1-PF),**

where **DR** - delegator reward,

**BR** - block reward,

**S** - shares,

**SR** - supercharged reward,

**PF** - pool fees.
