2\. Select a version of polkadot app you want to use. There are two versions of the app: hosted and IPFS one. The first one is more frequoently updated, but the second one is loaded in more decentralized way. If one of them is not loaded or doesn't operate properly, you may use the other one. We select IPFS version of the app because we like decentralization.

3\. Confirm access of the Polkadot.js wallet extension to the Polkadot.js app.

14\. In "Bonding preferences" window enter the amount you want to stake into the "value bonded" field. Leave \~100 HDX unstaked for future transaction fees.

Note that validator can accept just 64 HDX delegations to which it will distribute rewards. Other delegations (e. g. 65th, 66th, 67th ones etc.) to a validator will not gain rewards. This is a feature of the HDX network so that it is truly decentralized and no validator is given more control.

Almost all validators in the HDX network has more than 64 delegations. This set of delegations is determined by the number of HDX tokens in the delegation, not by the order of delegating. For example, a delegator delegates 65th in the queue, but his delegation has more tokens than the delegator who delegated 64th and receives rewards currently. Then the delegator with more tokens displaces the delegator from the 64th position and enters the set of delegators receiving rewards. And the delegator who previously held the 64th position is dropped from this set and ceases to receive rewards.

In order to delegate tokens to the Staketab validator, there must be more than 675.4950 HDX tokens in the delegation. You can check the latest number of required tokens in the Overview tab of the Staking section by selecting any validator from there.
