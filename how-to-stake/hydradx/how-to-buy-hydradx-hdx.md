# How to buy HydraDX (HDX)

At the moment it is not possible to buy HDX tokens elsewhere because there is a testnet now and they all are frozen until mainnet.&#x20;

There are two options to get HDX tokens. The first one was during the a HydraDX Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping pool started on Monday 8.2.2021 at about 4pm GMT and ended on Wednesday 11.2.2021 (blocks: 11817007 to 11836793). If you missed this opportunity, you can get HDX as a bonus during partnership project distributions, for example [Basilisk](https://hydradx.substack.com/p/introducing-basilisk). Follow the HydraDX [Telegram channel](https://t.me/hydradx) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hydra\_dx) for the announcements.
