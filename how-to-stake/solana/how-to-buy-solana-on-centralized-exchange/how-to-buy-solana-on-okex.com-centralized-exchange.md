4\. Select an asset you want to deposit by scrolling the list or typing into the field. Solana is traded in a pair with the stabelcoin USDT, so the fastest way to buy it is to make a deposit in USDT. But if you have another asset, you can make a deposit with it, then exchange it into USDT using the [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/join/2995542) terminal. There are two subguides below: how to buy SOL with USDT and how to buy SOL with another asset.

## How to buy SOL with USDT

1\. Select USDT as depositing asset and choose a network: Ethereum (ERC-20), TRON (TRC-20) or OKExChain. Make sure you choose the network that transfers your stabelcoin, otherwise the funds just won't come.

## How to buy SOL depositing another asset

To buy SOL with another asset (e. g. BTC, ETH, XRP, MATIC), you need to deposit this asset first the same way you deposit USDT, then exchange an asset to the USDT and exchange USDT for SOL.

## How to withdraw SOL from OKEx

1\. Get back to your trading account and check the SOL balance. To withdraw SOL to the external wallet, click on the three dots in the "Action" column of your Trading account, select "Transfer" and move the funds into the Funding account to withdraw Solana to the external wallet and then stake.&#x20;
