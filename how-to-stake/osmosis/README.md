# OSMOSIS

To stake Osmosis, you first need to get it. A fast and convenient way to get OSMO is to buy ATOM on centralized exchange first and then swapp one to OSMO using Osmosis DEX. ATOM is a native token of the Cosmos network as well as OSMO is a native token of the Osmosis network.

The guide below shows how to do all of that using [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) wallet, [OKex](https://www.okex.com/join/2995542) centralized exchange and [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/) decentralized exchange in sequential order.
