4. Select an asset you want to deposit by scrolling the list or typing into the field. ATOM is traded in a pair with the USDT stabelcoin \(its price equal to the US dollar\), so the fastest way to buy ATOM is to make a deposit in USDT. But if you have another asset, you can make a deposit with it. After deposit in this asset, just exchange it into USDT using the [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/join/2995542) terminal. 

So, there are two subguides below: how to buy ATOM with USDT and how to buy ATOM with another asset.

## How to buy ATOM with USDT

1. Select USDT as depositing asset and choose a network: Ethereum \(ERC-20\), TRON \(TRC-20\) or OKExChain. Make sure you choose the correct network of your stablecoin to deposit, otherwise the funds just won't come.

## How to buy ATOM depositing another asset

To buy ATOM with another asset \(e. g. BTC, ETH, XRP, MATIC\), you need to deposit this asset first the same way you deposit USDT, then exchange the asset to the USDT and then exchange USDT for ATOM.

## How to withdraw ATOM from OKEx

1. Get back to your trading account and check the ATOM balance. To withdraw ATOM to the external wallet, click on the three dots in the "Action" column of your Trading account, select "Transfer" and move the ATOM funds into your Funding account. To withdraw ATOM to the external wallet you need to move it there.

When transfer is successful, the balance of your Trading account will be reduced by the amount you moved to the Funding account.
