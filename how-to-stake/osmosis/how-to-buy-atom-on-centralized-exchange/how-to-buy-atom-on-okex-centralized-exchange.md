4\. Select an asset you want to deposit by scrolling the list or typing into the field. ATOM is traded in a pair with the USDT stabelcoin (its price equal to the US dollar), so the fastest way to buy ATOM is to make a deposit in USDT. But if you have another asset, you can make a deposit with it. After deposit in this asset, just exchange it into USDT using the [OKX](https://www.okex.com/join/2995542) terminal.&#x20;

So, there are two subguides below: how to buy ATOM with USDT and how to buy ATOM with another asset.

5\. Select USDT as depositing asset and choose a network: Ethereum (ERC-20), TRON (TRC-20) or OKExChain. Make sure you choose the correct network of your stablecoin to deposit, otherwise the funds just won't come.

## How to buy ATOM depositing another asset

To buy ATOM with another asset (e. g. BTC, ETH, XRP, MATIC), you need to deposit this asset first the same way you deposit USDT, then exchange the asset to the USDT and then exchange USDT for ATOM.
